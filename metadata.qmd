Attributes for range shifts data:

* `Polygon.Name`: Name of Polygon
    * Each study area has a unique polygon title. Polygon title was generated by concatenating the PaperID_availability_geographical location.</udom>
* `paperid`: Numerical ID assigned to each research article entered in the matrix that has passed Title/Abstract Review
* `speriod`: Study Period
    * Indicates specific study period(s) for each study (e.g. P1, P2 …). Although many studies have only one period (data were collected from time period 1 and then time period 2, a study may have multiple study periods if time intervals were not the same for each species included in the study. In this case, enter each distinct time period as a separate line.
* `tyear`: Total years studied
    * `NA`: No Data, includes papers that have a date range > 10 years.</edomvd>
    * (End Year-Start Year)+1: If there is a date range in the start and/or end period, use the mid-point of each period to calculate total years studied.  If the author(s) provide median years for the start and end period, then use that instead of calculating as above.  Note: If start date is unclear (e.g. “pre-1970s”) and you cannot calculate total years studied, you should not calculate km/dec shift. Shifts in these cases can be entered qualitatively.

    * `opportunistic`: Range shifts calculated from paired designs such as permanent plots or data cleaning or resampling procedure carried out to calculate range shifts on a balanced dataset (e.g. resurvey conducted in the same general area but not the same plots and authors made sure number of sampling units in both time periods was identical)
